The key result of this article was to constrain the location of the source regions of different types of pulsating auroras.  These observations provided new insights into the nature of the processes that drive pulsating aurora.  The publishing journal is not open access so the article cannot be viewed without payment at the time of writing, but it should become freely available before September 2021.

The figures in this article are quite technical and require more explanation that some of my other work, but I will try to briefly summarize them.

This figure illustrates the operation of a tool I built to identify the latitudinal boundaries of the different types of pulsating aurora in ground-based camera data.  I only identified the boundaries every 30 minutes to simplify the process, clicking near the edge of where the pulsating auroras were visible in the latitude-time image.

These pulsating aurora boundaries were then positioned relative to an empirically defined boundary visible in proton aurora, called the optical b2i.  The optical b2i approximately indicates where the magnetic field of Earth begins to resemble a dipole most closely.  Analyzing the location of pulsating auroras relative to the optical b2i provided new information about the magnetic topology of their source regions, and by extension, the types of processes that could be driving them.

The final figures places the results for a large number of events into a histogram to provide a general picture of where pulsating auroras occur relative to the optical b2i.
