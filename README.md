The key result of this article was to constrain the location of the source regions of different types of pulsating auroras.  These observations provided new insights into the nature of the processes that drive pulsating aurora.  The publishing journal is not open access so the article cannot be viewed without payment at the time of writing, but it should become freely available before September 2021.

The figures in this article are more technical and require more explanation that some of my others.
